                            I am an English Major and Shakespearen. Here is one of my favorite 'snippets' of
                            Shakespear's The Merchant of Venice.
                            Enjoy!</p>

                        <p> In Venice, a merchant named Antonio worries that his ships are overdue.
                            As his colleagues offer comfort, his young friends‚ÄîBassanio, Graziano, and Lorenzo‚Äîarrive.
                            Bassanio asks Antonio for a loan, so that he can pursue the wealthy Portia, who lives in
                            Belmont.
                            Antonio cannot afford the loan. Instead, he sends Bassanio to borrow the money on the
                            security of
                            Antonio's expected shipments.
                        </p>

                        <p> At Belmont, Portia and her maid, Nerissa, discuss the suitors who have come in response to
                            Portia's
                            father's strange will.
                            The will says Portia may only marry a man who chooses the correct casket made from three
                            possible
                            options: gold, silver, and lead.
                            Much to Portia's distress, all her suitors are unsatisfactory.
                            However, she does fondly remember a time when Bassanio came to Belmont, and that leaves her
                            with
                            some hope.
                            Bassanio approaches Shylock, a Jewish moneylender, about the loan.
                            Shylock holds a grudge against Antonio for his lending practices and apparent antisemitism.
                            Still he offers Bassanio the loan.
                            Instead of charging interest, seemingly as a kind of joke, he asks for a pound of Antonio's
                            flesh if
                            the loan isn't repaid within three months.
                            The bond is agreed to (who wouldn't agree to that?) and Bassanio prepares to leave for
                            Belmont with
                            his friend Graziano. </p>
