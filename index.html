                <p> I am a girl with a heart of a New Yorker and soul of a Minnesnowtan,
                    paving a way for women in tech to achieve their goals of becoming code ninjas.
                    Since I am not very good at talking about myself, I will fill the rest of the space
                    with a 'snippet' of Shakespear's The Merchant of Venice. Enjoy!</p>

                <p>In Venice, a merchant named Antonio worries that his ships are overdue.
                    As his colleagues offer comfort, his young friends—Bassanio, Graziano, and Lorenzo—arrive.
                    Bassanio asks Antonio for a loan, so that he can pursue the wealthy Portia, who lives in Belmont.
                    Antonio cannot afford the loan. Instead, he sends Bassanio to borrow the money on the security of
                    Antonio's expected shipments.
                </p>

                <p>At Belmont, Portia and her maid, Nerissa, discuss the suitors who have come in response to Portia's
                    father's strange will.
                    The will says Portia may only marry a man who chooses the correct casket made from three possible
                    options: gold, silver, and lead.
                    Much to Portia's distress, all her suitors are unsatisfactory.
                    However, she does fondly remember a time when Bassanio came to Belmont, and that leaves her with
                    some hope.
                    Bassanio approaches Shylock, a Jewish moneylender, about the loan.
                    Shylock holds a grudge against Antonio for his lending practices and apparent antisemitism.
                    Still he offers Bassanio the loan.
                    Instead of charging interest, seemingly as a kind of joke, he asks for a pound of Antonio's flesh if
                    the loan isn't repaid within three months.
                    The bond is agreed to (who wouldn't agree to that?) and Bassanio prepares to leave for Belmont with
                    his friend Graziano. </p>
